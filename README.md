# ThePentesterToolbar
A curated *online* resources list designed for any IT enthusiast, security-oriented. Basically would look like what results flattening my browser toolbar, with some more exotic ingredients.

&nbsp;

The particularity of this sites compilation is the hybridation between EN and FR sources, with clear split for each topic. Also, since it regroups online stuff, pentesting (and other) locally used tools are not directly mentionned, but retrievable from other Awesome lists referenced here (as it IS itself online stuff). 

Consider the following convention : a source is marked with a :heavy_check_mark: when regularly used/updated and can be claimed as really useful and relevant in the list. In the long term this list is intended to become claimable as an Awesome list, when all resources cited are marked :heavy_check_mark:. A script is being developped to allow importing all those sites on a structured manner in your favorite internet browser bookmarks system !
