# ThePentesterToolbar
A kinda well structured online resources list designed for any IT enthusiast, security-oriented. Basically would look like what results flattening my browser toolbar, with some more exotic ingredients. 
The particularity of this sites compilation is the hybridation between EN and FR sources. Of course the split is clear for each topic. Also consider the following convention : a source is marked with a  :heavy_check_mark: when regularly used/updated and can be claimed as really useful and relevant in the list.
